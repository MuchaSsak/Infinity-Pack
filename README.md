Official repository for every major software release by Fungus Inc. Finally open-source! üçÑ

### Support for Linux üêß
Our software is initially designed to work on newer Windows operating systems, but some of it works on Linux (often times with limited features). Ones that are meant to work are listed down below:

- Grzybica 1.0 (Well-supported)
- Eden 1.0 (Well-supported)
- Grzybica GO (Well-supported)
- Fungus Endgame (Decently-supported)
- Eden Endgame (Decently-supported)

Any bugs or errors can be reported in the Issues section. Feedback is appreciated.

### How to run the Endgame Brothers üîÆ
1.  Navigate to the `fungus_endgame`/`eden_endgame` folder using a terminal
2. Assuming you have Python installed, type the following command:
	`py gui.pyw`
	It's likely that if you try to run the program first time on the computer you're currently using errors will occur. That's expected, all you need to do is install the libraries that you're missing. That's happening because some of them are not included in Python by default like `pillow`, `shutil`, `tk`.
	To install the missing libraries, simply type: `pip install <name-of-library>`
3. If all missing libraries are installed, the program should execute correctly!
